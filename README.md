Lottery_Program
I created this program for a minimum wage job I worked.
Every day we would have to inventory the lottery. 
We originally did it on paper, but that took too long and was inefficient.
I eventually created an excel file for it and added some buttons to it for easier use.
This was a step in the right direction, but the excel file was cleared every few weeks so no valuable selling data was collected.
That is what made me decide to make this program.
I created this program so that the amount of lottery sold would be easily tracked, and also for the number enterting to be extremely easy.
This is my first program using Tkinter.
